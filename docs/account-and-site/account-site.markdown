# Account and Site Management
How to request new accounts, modify existing accounts, or request changes to your site and organization information.


## Manage ECE Reporter accounts

### Request a new account
Accounts and account permissions were generated from responses to the Data Managers survey that was circulated to the organization main points of contact. 

If you would like to request an account for yourself or someone else at your organization:
[Needs help link.]

Once we receive the request, we will verify with the organization main point of contact that the person indicated should have an account. Once we have verified that information, an account will be created. The new account information will be shared with that person, including instructions to set a password and log into ECE Reporter. 

This process can take between 5-10 business days, depending on the verification process. We will send an initial email confirming the receipt of the request and provide updates as we have them!
