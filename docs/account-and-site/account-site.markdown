# Account and Site Management
How to request new accounts, modify existing accounts, or request changes to your site and organization information.


## Manage ECE Reporter accounts

### Request a new account
Accounts and account permissions were generated from responses to the Data Managers survey that was circulated to the organization main points of contact. 

Make a request through the form on this page:
https://help.ece-reporter.ctoec.org//get-support/

Once we receive the request, we will verify with the organization main point of contact that the person indicated should have an account. Once we have verified that information, an account will be created. The new account information will be shared with that person, including instructions to set a password and log into ECE Reporter. 

This process can take between 5-10 business days, depending on the verification process. We will send an initial email confirming the receipt of the request and provide updates as we have them!


### Reset your password
To reset your password for an existing ECE Reporter account:
- Go to https://ece-reporter.ctoec.org/
- Click the log-in button
- Click the "forgot password" link on the login to ECE Reporter page
- Enter the email associated with your ECE Reporter account
- If we have an account for the email address provided, an email from Connecticut Office of Early Childhood <no-reply@ctoec.org> with password reset instructions will be sent
