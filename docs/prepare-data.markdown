## Review the data requirements

You can find the latest definitions, rationale and accepted formats for every field collected in ECE Reporter on the data definition page in ECE Reporter.

[View the data requirements](https://ece-reporter.ctoec.org/data-requirements)

--- 

## Decide your method of data entry
ECE Reporter supports two methods:
1. Enter data in OEC's template and upload all your enrollments at once. See the rest of this guide for instructions.
2. Enter enrollment records one at a time. See [working with child records](/child-records/) for more guidance.


## Enrollments to include
- Children receiving funding through the following programs:
- Child Day Care
- Competitive School Readiness
- Priority School Readiness
- State Head Start
- Smart Start

## Download the latest data upload template

ECE Reporter will only accept data in the latest template file format. You can download the template in ECE Reporter.

[Download the latest template](https://ece-reporter.ctoec.org/template)

## Export or gather data from your system of record

Your program may have the data ECE Reporter is requesting in a system of record such as ChildPlus or Powerschool.

If you have IT support, they may be able to work with you to create a report from your system of record with the data OEC requires. This can help avoid double data entry.

## Enter your data in OEC's template

Once you've read through the data requirements and gathered your enrollment data, it's time to enter it into OEC's data template. 


*   Add all the enrollment data you manage to [OEC’s data template](https://ece-reporter.ctoec.org/template). You cannot use any other file to upload data to ECE Reporter.
*   If you upload a file to ECE Reporter, you will erase any data for the sites you’re uploading data to.
* To keep things simple, make sure your data is as close to done as possible before uploading.
*   ECE Reporter will check your data and prompt you to resolve any errors.
*   If you need to make small updates, don’t worry! All of the data can be edited in the ECE Reporter tool.

### Here's what a completed record without any enrollment or funding changes will look like:

### Add enrollments that have changed

When you’re updating several months of data at once, you'll need to record enrollment and funding changes that happened during that time. This section will show you how to add those historical updates to OEC's data template.

Here are the enrollment changes you'll need to record:
*   Changes to enrolled site
*   Changes to age group
*   Changes to funding types


To add these changes:

1. Create a row with the most recent enrollment data for the child
2. Fill in all required fields in that row
3. Create another row for the child’s past enrollment(s)
4. Make sure all of the fields in the child identifiers section match in every row referring to the same child
5. In the new enrollment history row, add the previous enrollment and funding info to indicate the changes
6. All other fields can be blank for the enrollment history row

See the examples below.
