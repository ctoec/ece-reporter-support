## General

### Where is my ECIS data?
We are working to migrate existing ECIS data to the new reporting tool, ECE Reporter.

If your information in ECIS is up to date and correct and you would prefer we pull it from there, then we’d recommend that you wait until we have more information to share regarding the data migration process.

If you do not want to wait, then data should be entered into the new system for the July - December 2020 time period.

## Log in

### I haven’t received the email to create my password.
The email would have come from no-reply@ctoec.org, so please check your spam and other folders. If you can’t locate that email, you are also able to reset your password by going to ECE Reporter (https://ece-reporter.ctoec.org/) and using the Forgot Password link that can be found upon clicking Log in. 

Once you’ve reset your password, you should be able to log in to ECE Reporter using your email address as your username and your newly set password. 

### When I click the link to create my password, it says “Access Denied”. 
The link to reset your password most likely expired, but you are still able to reset your password by going to ECE Reporter (https://ece-reporter.ctoec.org/) and using the Forgot Password link that can be found upon clicking Log in. 

Once you’ve reset your password, you should be able to log in to ECE Reporter using your email address as your username and your newly set password.

## Accounts

### I need to add another person to have access to our site/organization. 
Please provide us with the person’s name, email address, and the sites that they should have access to in ECE Reporter. Once we receive that information, our team will create their account and they will receive communications as to how to log into ECE Reporter.

### Missing Sites or Funding


### We used to be able to select federal Head Start (or private pay) in ECIS. Why is that not an option now?
At this time, ECE Reporter is only collecting child enrollment data for state-funded programs: Child Day Care, School Readiness, Smart Start, and State Head Start. You do not need to enter data for children funded by federal Head Start or private pay.

### Why do funding periods only go as far back as July 2019?
ECE Reporter is only collecting data as far back as fiscal year 2020, which began in July 2019. For children who have been receiving funding since before that, please select July 2019 as the first funding period.
