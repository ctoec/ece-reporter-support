### Acceptable data template updates
At the moment, only the following are supported in the data template to be used for uploading updates into ECE Reporter:
- A new child
- An existing child with updated birth certificate information (Birth certificate type, Birth certificate ID #, Town of birth, and State of birth)
- An existing child with updated address (Street address, Cty, State, and Zipcode)
- A withdrawn child with ended enrollment (Enrollment end date, Enrollment exit reason, Last reporting period)
- An existing child with ended enrollment and a new enrollment

Note: if your updated data template includes rows for children already in ECE Reporter with no changes, ECE Reporter will detect those as duplicates and not upload them into the system. You can verify this on the preview page prior to saving the updates to your roster.
