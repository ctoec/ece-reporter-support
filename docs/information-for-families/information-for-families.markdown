## What is ECE Reporter
The Early Care and Education (ECE) Reporter is a secure online data system. With ECE Reporter, the Office of Early Childhood is able to collect data and information. This will help the Office of Early Childhood make informed program and policy decisions for young children and their families.
 
## How is child information protected?
Information in ECE Reporter is protected by the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act and the Health Insurance Portability and Accounting Act (HIPAA). Only select staff from early care and education programs will have access to information about children in their own programs in ECE Reporter. Select staff from the Office of Early Childhood will also have access to statewide data. Any sharing of information or reporting with other agencies will only be aggregate, de-identified information. This means data that is shared will not have any information that is specific to one child or that allows a child to be identified.
 
## Will all children have their data collected in ECE Reporter?
The state is allowed to collect data on children enrolled in publicly-funded early childhood programs. Parents of children in publicly-funded early childhood programs will get a notice that their child’s information is being collected in ECE Reporter. 
 
## Do parents have access to their child's record?
Parents have the right to see their child’s ECE Reporter record. An electronic record is started when a child enrolls in a publicly funded early care and education program and is updated when the child leaves. A parent may ask for a copy of their child’s ECE Reporter record. If a parent does not agree with something in the record, they can ask to have it changed.
